# ChooZen-backend
## Description :

Backend part of the ChooZen project.

This app allows users to create groups, where they can invite friends, family, etc... 
Then, every user of a group can propose a movie/tv series to watch which will be added to a list. 
The goal is for every member of the group to communicate how much they want to watch something. So users of a group can vote on how soon they want to watch a proposed media.

An average score is then calculated, and on the `"Next"` page, the list of movies that a user has voted is displayed, sorted by the highest average score.

The goal is to simplify the process of choosing what to watch with people you tend to watch movies / tv series with often. When you want to watch something, just go to the `"Next"` page and watch the highest rated movie/tv series.

In further iterations of the app, there will be multiple filters to make the list more precise, like filtering by genre, type (movie, tv series, shortfilm, etc...).
